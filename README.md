You can find the conversations in the `data.json` file.

# Requirements:
* Python 3.7
* Internet connection
* [SentiWordNet](https://github.com/aesuli/SentiWordNet/blob/master/data/SentiWordNet_3.0.0.txt)

# Installation:
Get the `SentiWordNet_3.0.0.txt` file in the root folder.

Best approach would be to create a virtual environment with Python 3.7 and then run `python install -r requirements.txt`.

# Fixes planned:
* Alternative for scraping Google Search results
* Reduce wait time for ConceptNet.
